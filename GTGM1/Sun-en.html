    <h2>Sun</h2>
    
    <p>The Sun is one of the stars in our Galaxy (the Milky Way) and the only star of the Solar System. Other objects of this system revolve around the Sun: planets and their moons, dwarf planets and their moons, asteroids, meteoroids, comets, and cosmic dust.</p>

    <p>The Sun consists of 73% hydrogen and 25% helium. It is the closest star to Earth. The average distance from the Sun to Earth — 149.6 million km — is approximately equal to an astronomical unit, and the apparent angular diameter when observed from Earth, like that of the Moon, is slightly more than half a degree (31—32 minutes). The Sun is located at a distance of about 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way and orbits around it on an elliptical orbit, completing one revolution every 225-250 million years. The orbital speed of the Sun is 217 km/s - thus, it passes through a light-year in about 1,400 Earth years, and one astronomical unit in 8 Earth days.</p>

    <h2>The Origin of the Sun</h2>
    <p>It is believed that the Sun formed 4.5 billion years ago. One of the prevalent theories of the origin of the Solar System suggests that its formation was triggered by explosions of one or several supernovae. This assumption is based, among other things, on the fact that the substance of the Solar System contains an anomalously large fraction of gold and uranium, which could be the result of endothermic reactions caused by this explosion, or nuclear transformation of elements by absorbing neutrons by the substance of a massive second-generation star.</p>

    <h2>The Future of the Star</h2>
    <p>According to scientists' estimates, in about 7.6-7.8 billion years, by the age of 12.2 billion years, the core of the Sun will heat up so much that it will trigger the process of hydrogen burning in its shell. This will cause a violent expansion of the star's outer shells, thus the Sun will leave the main sequence, on which it has been since its birth, and become a red giant. In this phase, the radius of the Sun will increase by 256 times compared to the present. The expansion of the star will lead to a significant increase in its luminosity (by 2,700 times) and cooling of the surface to 2650 K. Obviously, the expanding outer layers of the Sun at this time will reach the modern orbit of the Earth. Studies in 2008 show that the Earth will most likely be engulfed by the Sun due to the slowing down of the Sun's rotation and subsequent tidal interactions with its outer envelope, which will lead to the orbit of the Earth moving back towards the Sun. Even if the Earth avoids being engulfed by the Sun, all the water on it will turn into a gaseous state, and its atmosphere will be torn apart by the most powerful solar wind.</p>

    <h2>Solar Activity</h2>
    <p>The complex of phenomena caused by the generation of strong magnetic fields on the Sun is called solar activity. These fields manifest themselves in the photosphere as sunspots and cause phenomena such as solar flares, generation of streams of accelerated particles, changes in levels of electromagnetic radiation of the Sun in different ranges, coronal mass ejections, disturbances of the solar wind, variations of galactic cosmic ray fluxes, and so on.</p>
    <p>Geomagnetic activity variations (including magnetic storms) are also associated with solar activity, which are a consequence of disturbances of the interplanetary medium reaching Earth, caused, in turn, by active phenomena on the Sun.</p>
